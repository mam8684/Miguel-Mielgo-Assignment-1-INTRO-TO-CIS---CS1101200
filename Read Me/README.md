What tools did I used?

For the realization of this assignment, I looked up the information through various websites as well as different graphics and pictures in order to make it easier to learn for the spectators. For that, I used a web browser in order to look up information on different websites and then I used screenshots for acquiring pictures and graphics.

How did I created it?

Basically, I first created a word document with all the information and then, I created a wiki on GitHub where I included all of the necessary information in a more visual way. 

Why did I created the project?

I decided to create this project because I wanted to show what really is a portable device and also because I also wanted to show what is the difference between a portable device and a mobile device.

What is the purpose of the project?

Like I said, because I wanted to show what really is a portable device and also because I also wanted to show what is the difference between a portable device and a mobile device.
